# My Dodge the Creeps
This is a tutorial project that I have created following the [official Godot documentation](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/step_by_step/your_first_game.html) to learn the basics of the Godot game engine.
After i finished the tutorial, I wanted to personalize it a bit, so I added a few features that I thought would be fun to have in the game.
This project was made to learn the basics of the Godot game engine, and it is not intended to be a full game.

# My Dodge the Creeps
This is a tutorial project that I have created following the [official Godot documentation](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/step_by_step/your_first_game.html) to learn the basics of the Godot game engine.
After i finished the tutorial, I wanted to personalize it a bit, so I added a few features that I thought would be fun to have in the game.
This project was made to learn the basics of the Godot game engine, and it is not intended to be a full game.

## Things I changed from the original tutorial
I decided that to feel the game more personal I changed the theme of the game, changing:
- the player sprite, that is from [Peneusbmic] (https://penusbmic.itch.io/) from [this asset pack](https://penusbmic.itch.io/sci-fi-character-pack-10)
- the enemies sprite:
  - the dragon enemy is from [Reekal Games](https://rekaalgames.itch.io/) from [this asset pack](https://rekaalgames.itch.io/2d-flying-enemy)
  - the eyeball enemy is my first original creation for this game, it's the first time I've ever drawn and animated something, so it's not the best, but I'm proud of it.
- the font of the game, that is the [blackbaron font](https://allbestfonts.com/black-baron/)
- the music of the game, that now consists in 4 tracks that where made by MusicFX AI tool from Google. Every time the game start there is a possibility of playing one of the 4 tracks.
- the background of the game, that is a from [Cainos](https://cainos.itch.io/) from [this asset pack](https://cainos.itch.io/pixel-art-top-down-basic)

## Things I added to the game
I really liked the tutorial when I finished it, but I thought it was a bit too simple and I saw a big potential in it, so I added a few features to make the game more fun:
- the last score label
- the power-up mechanic (every sprite of the power-ups are also made by me):
  - the shield power-up, that makes the player invincible for a few seconds
  - the speed power-up, that makes the player faster for a few seconds
  - the time power-up, that makes the enemy spawn slow down for a few seconds
- the dpad and joystick, for touch screen devices:
  - the dpad assets are from [JulioCacko](https://juliocacko.itch.io/) from [this asset pack](https://juliocacko.itch.io/free-input-prompts), i made the code to make it work
  - the joystick is a Godot plugin from an italian comrade, [MarcoFazioRandom](https://github.com/MarcoFazioRandom) from [this repository](https://github.com/MarcoFazioRandom/Virtual-Joystick-Godot)
- the pause menu, where there are:
  - the audio toggle, to mute the audio
  - when the game is played on mobile, there are the toggle buttons to select between dpad and joystick, or neither of them if you have plugged in a keyboard
  - the credits button that links to my github page

# Future of the game
This game started aut as a tutorial project, and now it's a bit more than that, but I don't intend to make it a full game, I just wanted to learn the basics of the Godot game engine, and I think I've achieved that. I will keep updating the game if I find something that I think would be fun to add, like a global leaderboard, but I don't have any plans for that yet.
Oblivously the issues and the pull request are welcome, if you have any idea to make the game better, feel free to share it with me.
